<h3>Resize to visible</h3>
It iterate on every leaf layer (layer without children), take their boundary, and calculate the minimum size of
the document (also named image/canvas) for them to fit into.<br>
<br>
It only take visible layers. It does not crop anything (nothing ever get deleted). Meaning, running this script after re-enabling a layer, that has something drawn
outside the canvas, will enlarge the canvas.<br>

<h3>Usage</h3>
Run the script in Tools --> Script --> Resize to visible

<h3>Use case</h3>
It is useful when you make a sprite, and want to remove the unused space before exporting.<br>

To setup a shortcut, go into `Configure Krita -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Scripts -> My Scripts -> Resize to visible`
